<br>We focused on answering the questions:
* What policies did countries enforce? Any trends or differences between countries with higher and lower death tolls?
* Were there any differences in response between women and men led countries?
<br>For our analysis we used three data sets:
<br>* Original WiD data set enriched with the information if a country has a women leader from [CFR](https://www.cfr.org/article/womens-power-index).
<br>* [CoronaNet research](https://www.coronanet-project.org/index.html) project with policies implemented per country during the pandemic.
<br>* [Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker](https://github.com/OxCGRT).
