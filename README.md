This repository contains the Python descriptive and predictive analysis of covid-19 related government responses globaly and for men and women led countries.

For our analysis we will used three data sets:
<br>* Original WiD data set enriched with the information if a country has a women leader from [CFR](https://www.cfr.org/article/womens-power-index)
<br>* [CoronaNet research](https://www.coronanet-project.org/index.html) project with policies implemented per country during the pandemic.
<br>* [Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker](https://github.com/OxCGRT)
